# RGBtoHDMI 6-bit TTL Edition
TexElec's RGBtoHDMI 6-Bit TTL Edition

We made this project to create a more desk-friendly version of the RGBtoHDMI.  It uses IanB's 6-bit TTL buffer along with the newest revision of the CPLD board.  While it 
is limited to 6-bit TTL in this form the primary intention is to be a replacement for the MCE2VGA.  This is quite useful for vintage PC collectors like myself, as it will 
make it easy to switch between systems.  We may produce other versions down the road, but this is really meant to be a turn-key version for specific uses and not a one-
size fits all design. 

You can buy a fully assembled version at our website: https://texelec.com

Thanks so much to Hoglet & Ian for this project!  Truly a fantastic effort and I suspect it may be around for many years to come!
